# JAVA-

This file is not a project file or anything like that, just a record of my java-study-way and save part of I newcomer's source code.

Cause when create this repository I was just a loser basically and didnt know a lot of computer science knowledges and even didnt know what codes are exactly.

So dear big guys dont accuse me and take it easy, maybe I'll delete it if I have enough code repositories or I have gain enough treasure or something liek that.
